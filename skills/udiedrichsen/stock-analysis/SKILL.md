# Stock Analysis

Analyze US stocks using Yahoo Finance data for quick actionable insights during earnings season.

## Quick Start

**IMPORTANT:** Pass ONLY the stock ticker symbol(s) as arguments. Do NOT add extra text, headers, or formatting in the command.

Analyze a single ticker:

```bash
uv run {baseDir}/scripts/analyze_stock.py AAPL
uv run {baseDir}/scripts/analyze_stock.py MSFT --output json
```

Compare multiple tickers:

```bash
uv run {baseDir}/scripts/analyze_stock.py AAPL MSFT GOOGL
```

**Examples:**
- ✅ CORRECT: `uv run {baseDir}/scripts/analyze_stock.py BAC`
- ❌ WRONG: `uv run {baseDir}/scripts/analyze_stock.py === BANK OF AMERICA (BAC) - Q4 2025 EARNINGS ===`
- ❌ WRONG: `uv run {baseDir}/scripts/analyze_stock.py "Bank of America"`

Use the ticker symbol only (e.g., BAC, not "Bank of America").

## Analysis Components

The script evaluates seven key dimensions:

1. **Earnings Surprise (30% weight)**: Actual vs expected EPS, revenue beats/misses
2. **Fundamentals (20% weight)**: P/E ratio, profit margins, revenue growth, debt levels
3. **Analyst Sentiment (20% weight)**: Consensus ratings, price target vs current price
4. **Historical Patterns (10% weight)**: Past earnings reactions, volatility
5. **Market Context (10% weight)**: VIX, SPY/QQQ trends, market regime
6. **Sector Performance (15% weight)**: Stock vs sector comparison, sector trends
7. **Momentum (15% weight)**: RSI, 52-week range, volume, relative strength

**Special Timing Checks:**
- Pre-earnings warning (< 14 days): Recommends HOLD instead of BUY
- Post-earnings spike detection (> 15% in 5 days): Flags "gains priced in"
- Overbought conditions (RSI > 70 + near 52w high): Reduces confidence

## Timing Warnings & Risk Flags

The script now detects high-risk scenarios:

- **Pre-Earnings Period**: If earnings < 14 days away, BUY signals become HOLD
- **Post-Earnings Spike**: If stock up > 15% in 5 days after earnings, warns "gains may be priced in"
- **Overbought Conditions**: RSI > 70 + near 52-week high = high-risk entry
- **Sector Weakness**: Stock may look good but sector is rotating out
- **High VIX**: Market fear (VIX > 30) reduces confidence in BUY signals

## Output Format

**Default (text)**: Concise buy/hold/sell signal with 3-5 bullet points and caveats

**JSON**: Structured data with scores, metrics, and raw data for further analysis

## Limitations

- **Data freshness**: Yahoo Finance may lag 15-20 minutes
- **Missing data**: Not all stocks have analyst coverage or complete fundamentals
- **Disclaimer**: All outputs include prominent "not financial advice" warning
- **US markets only**: Non-US tickers may have incomplete data

## Error Handling

The script gracefully handles:
- Invalid tickers → Clear error message
- Missing analyst data → Signal based on available metrics only
- API failures → Retry with exponential backoff, fail after 3 attempts
